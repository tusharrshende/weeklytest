### Frameworks and Language Used
- Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate
- Language: Java
- Database: MySQL

### Data Flow

1. **Controller**
   - Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.
   - Maps HTTP endpoints to service methods.
   - Handles request and response data conversion (e.g., JSON).

2. **Services**
   - Contains business logic for CRUD operations and other operations.
   - Communicates with repositories to perform database operations.
   - May include validation and error handling.

3. **Repository**
   - Uses Spring Data JPA to provide data access and persistence.
   - Defines CRUD methods for interacting with the database.
   - Represents the data layer.

### Database Design

- **Student Table**
   - Columns: ID, name, age, phoneNumber, branch, department, address_id
- **Laptop Table**
   - Columns: ID, name, brand, price, student_id
- **Course Table**
   - Columns: ID, title, description, duration
- **Book Table**
   - Columns: ID, title, author, description, price, student_id
- **Address Table**
   - Columns: addressId, landmark, zipcode, district, state, country

### Project Summary

The Student Management project is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Boot framework, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate for data access. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing students, laptops, courses, books, and addresses. The application follows a structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where controllers handle HTTP requests, services contain business logic, and repositories handle data access.

Users can perform the following actions:

- Add, update, view, and delete student records.
- Add, update, view, and delete laptop records associated with students.
- Add, update, view, and delete course records.
- Add, update, view, and delete book records associated with students.
- Add, update, view, and delete address records.

The application is designed to facilitate efficient management of student-related data, including their personal information, course enrollments, laptops, and books. It features a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction with the system. The database schema is structured to capture relevant student information and relationships between entities.
